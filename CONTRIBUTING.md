Contributing to grunt-wslint
================================

I have a liberal attitude towards accepting pull requests.  If you have a good idea, I'll take it.

The existing code was extracted from [mountebank](https://github.com/bbyars/mountebank) and conforms
to the whitespace standards for that project, but there are obviously other standards.  Feel free to
add them.
